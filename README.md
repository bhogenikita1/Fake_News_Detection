# 📰 Fake_News_Detection

This project aims to detect fake news using machine learning techniques and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The dataset is processed and used to train a classifier that can differentiate between real and fake news.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Fake_News_Detection.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing the code for loading data, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- NLP (CountVectorizer / TF-IDF)
- Logistic Regression (or any ML model used)

## 🔍 Dataset

The dataset contains text-based news articles labeled as either "FAKE" or "REAL". Make sure to download and place the dataset (if needed) in the appropriate location or use the one integrated in the notebook.

## ⚙️ Features

- Text Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Vectorization using CountVectorizer
- Training using Logistic Regression (can be changed)
- Model Accuracy and Evaluation
- Prediction on new/unseen text samples

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
   cd fake-news-detection

## 📈 Output


Model accuracy on test data

Classification report and confusion matrix

Prediction results for custom news input



## ✅ Future Enhancements


Use deep learning models (LSTM, BERT)

Deploy as a web app using Flask/Django

Create an interactive interface for users
